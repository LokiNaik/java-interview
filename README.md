# Interview Preparation - Java & Spring Boot

This repository is designed to help you prepare for technical interviews with a focus on **Java** and **Spring Boot**. It includes a collection of **conceptual Java interview questions** along with answers, and **coding problems** that are solved using Java. 
The project is structured to provide a comprehensive resource for both theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to support interview preparation for Java developers by providing:

- A variety of **conceptual questions** that cover essential topics such as Java fundamentals, OOP principles, design patterns, concurrency, JVM internals, and more.
- A set of **coding problems** with detailed solutions, including problems related to algorithms, data structures, and other common technical interview topics.

This project is not just limited to conceptual knowledge, but also includes Java-based coding challenges, which can help you practice the skills needed for coding interviews.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Conceptual Questions & Answers**  
   A collection of commonly asked interview questions that focus on Java theory. These questions will help you brush up on core concepts, frameworks, and programming principles.

2. **Coding Challenges & Solutions**  
   A series of coding problems, including classic algorithmic and data structure problems. Solutions are implemented in Java and are designed to demonstrate best practices for solving interview-style questions.

In addition to these, the project uses **Spring Boot** to showcase backend-related questions, with some solutions that demonstrate how you would handle real-world interview problems in a Java-based application.

## Features

- **Conceptual Interview Questions**: Covers a wide range of Java-related topics and their explanations.
- **Coding Problem Solutions**: Provides Java solutions for common interview questions, including algorithms, data structures, etc.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Demonstrates how to use Spring Boot for backend-related coding questions and API development.
- **Well-Organized Directory Structure**: Code and explanations are well-structured to ensure ease of navigation and understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, you will need to have the following installed:

- **Java 17 or higher**
- **Maven** (for building and managing dependencies)
- **Spring Boot** (optional, depending on whether you plan to run the backend)

### Clone the Repository
