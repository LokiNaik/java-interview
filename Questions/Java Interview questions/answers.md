The key differences between primitive data types and objects in Java are...

#### Primitive Data types:
- These are the most basic data types in Java and represent simple values. Examples include int, char, boolean, float, etc.
- They are stored directly in memory with their actual values. Each primitive type has a fixed size (e.g., int is 4 bytes).
- Faster because they store the raw values direclty.
- Primitive types are immutable.
#### Objects
- Objects are instances of classes, which can store data and have methods to operate on that data. Objects are more complex and are used to represent real-world entities.
- An object is stored as a reference (or memory address) to the location where the data (fields) is held in memory. This reference points to an instance of a class in the heap.
- Objects are slow because they involve in more complex operations.
- Objects are mutable they can be changed based on the class.
